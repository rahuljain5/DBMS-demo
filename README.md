Using XAMPP as a server would be a convinient way to run the files.

 - place the html,css,js and php files into the folder /opt/lampp/htdocs.(or /var/www/html if using Apache)

 - create a database using phpmyadmin on the XAMPP application page.

 - create all tables,insert values and also choose user privileges if needed.

 - on linux systems turn on apache2 server along with mysqlserver and proftpd server(manage servers tab)

 - once all this is done use OPEN APPLICATION FOLDER option from XAMPP window browse to the html file and open it. 

 - For tables and values refer the manual enclosed.

## Running the APP:

Open the browser and visit http://localhost/Directory-Name

## Note:

*The .php file should be run on a server as php needs server for processing.*

*changes have to be made into the php file in accordance with the database in use.*

*The databases should be made in mysql and appropriately mentioned in the php file.*  

*For windows based systems download WAMP or XAMPP for windows(the path for the files might be different).*
